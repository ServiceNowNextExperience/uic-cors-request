Make sure that you have the ServiceNow Command Line Interface (CLI) tools installed.

[https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/setting-up-command-line-interface-cli-for-custom-component-dev/ta-p/2361588](https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/setting-up-command-line-interface-cli-for-custom-component-dev/ta-p/2361588)

If you already have the tool installed, just pull this repo, make sure that you're connected to your instance using "snc ui-component login {instance_url} basic {user_name} {password}".

Then run "npm install" to load all of the NPM packages.
